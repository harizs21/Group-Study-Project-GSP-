This is Flappy Bird. But it’s not actually Flappy Bird. It’s a very changed and improved version of Flappy Bird. All I’ll say is Flappy Bird was a peaceful game. This is not peaceful. 

Download pygame

Run the game through main.py

When saving a score, sadly you will have to type your name in through the text-based interface

Don’t touch the snakes or pipes

Only top 10 scores will show on leaderboard

Press Q to Quit after finishing the game

“Classic” mode will not work since Muaaz gave us his code too late

Short Tutorial:
Go to main.py
Run the program
Click on Difficulty
Choose your difficulty level and which game mode you want to play(Start with easy)
Use up and down keys to move up and down
Dodge the objects
Also don’t hit the ground
When you die, click s to save score
Go into text-based interface to type name
When you play the game again you should see your score with your name beside it(after you have died and pressed L, for leaderboard)
Play as many times as you want, just don’t get too addicted
